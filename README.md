# hello-world

hello!
My name is Jack, I am a profesional trampolinist, I have won 1st place multiple times at kansas and missouri state championships, 2/2 times at region 4 championships, and the one (hopefully soon to be two) times I have been at nationals. I love building things and using computers, I love to game, and am decently good at my favorate game; Rocket League. 
P.S. If you are confused as to what exactly profesional trampoline is, check out Jason Burnett on Youtube.
